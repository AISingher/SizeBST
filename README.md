# SizeBST
A Binary Search Tree representation, but also capable of finding how many nodes in the tree hold numbers <=j, a given number. Nodes have extra data called "size", which indicates the number of nodes in the left subtree of the current node, +1 for the current node.

SizeBST.java represents the Binary Search Tree itself while SizeBSTN represents its nodes with j implementation.
